            STKLOS SUPPORTED SRFIS


The "Scheme Requests for Implementation" (SRFI) process is an approach
to help Scheme users to write portable and yet useful code. It is a
forum for people interested in coordinating libraries and other
additions to the Scheme language between implementations.

STklos tries to supports as much as possible the "Final" SRFIs. For a
definition of what is a final SRFI, you should have a look at the
SRFI home page at http://srfi.schemers.org/

Any help for supporting new SRFIs in STklos is welcome.

The list of the implemented SRFIs in this version is given below (the ones
implemented in latest version is available at https://stklos.net/srfi.html):
