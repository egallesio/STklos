# This script is only used to compile the different components of the
# system which need compilation. It will not be installed since the
# user version is the stklos-compile script.

# When the environment variable KEEP_FORMALS is "1", compilation will be done with
# the flag "keep-formals" turned on.

# I have tried to use "-F '+keep-formals'" and also "--compiler-flags='+keep-formals'"

# reason the option ws not recognized. But directly evalauting an expression that sets
# the keep-formals parameter works, so that's what we do!
#
# So -- The Makefiles that cll tmpcomp NEED to set the KEEP_FORMALS vraiable
# when calling, as in
#     KEEP_FORMALS=@KEEP_FORMALS@ tmpcomp ...
