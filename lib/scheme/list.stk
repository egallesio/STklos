;;;; This code is an adaptation of the reference implementation provided
;;;; with the SRFI document by Olin Shivers.
;;;;
;;;;  Adaptation for STklos
;;;;     - All the error calls have been replaced to be conform with the STklos
;;;;       error procedure
;;;;     - definition of the macro check-arg
;;;;     - Functions using let-optional have been rewritten using the
;;;;       extended procedure of STklos

;;; This is a library of list- and pair-processing functions. I wrote it after
;;; carefully considering the functions provided by the libraries found in
;;; R4RS/R5RS Scheme, MIT Scheme, Gambit, RScheme, MzScheme, slib, Common
;;; Lisp, Bigloo, guile, T, APL and the SML standard basis. It is a pretty
;;; rich toolkit, providing a superset of the functionality found in any of
;;; the various Schemes I considered.

;;; This implementation is intended as a portable reference implementation
;;; for SRFI-1. See the porting notes below for more information.

;;; In principle, the following R4RS list- and pair-processing procedures
;;; are also part of this package's exports, although they are not defined
;;; in this file:
;;;   Primitives: cons pair? null? car cdr set-car! set-cdr!
;;;   Non-primitives: list length append reverse cadr ... cddddr list-ref
;;;                   memq memv assq assv
;;;   (The non-primitives are defined in this file, but commented out.)
;;;
;;; These R4RS procedures have extended definitions in SRFI-1 and are defined
;;; in this file:
;;;   map for-each member assoc
;;;
;;; The remaining two R4RS list-processing procedures are not included:
;;;   list-tail (use drop)
;;;   list? (use proper-list?)


;;; A note on recursion and iteration/reversal:
;;; Many iterative list-processing algorithms naturally compute the elements
;;; of the answer list in the wrong order (left-to-right or head-to-tail) from
;;; the order needed to cons them into the proper answer (right-to-left, or
;;; tail-then-head). One style or idiom of programming these algorithms, then,
;;; loops, consing up the elements in reverse order, then destructively
;;; reverses the list at the end of the loop. I do not do this. The natural
;;; and efficient way to code these algorithms is recursively. This trades off
;;; intermediate temporary list structure for intermediate temporary stack
;;; structure. In a stack-based system, this improves cache locality and
;;; lightens the load on the GC system. Don't stand on your head to iterate!
;;; Recurse, where natural. Multiple-value returns make this even more
;;; convenient, when the recursion/iteration has multiple state values.

;;; Porting:
;;; This is carefully tuned code; do not modify casually.
;;;   - It is careful to share storage when possible;
;;;   - Side-effecting code tries not to perform redundant writes.
;;;
;;; That said, a port of this library to a specific Scheme system might wish
;;; to tune this code to exploit particulars of the implementation.
;;; The single most important compiler-specific optimisation you could make
;;; to this library would be to add rewrite rules or transforms to:
;;; - transform applications of n-ary procedures (e.g. LIST=, CONS*, APPEND,
;;;   LSET-UNION) into multiple applications of a primitive two-argument
;;;   variant.
;;; - transform applications of the mapping functions (MAP, FOR-EACH, FOLD,
;;;   ANY, EVERY) into open-coded loops. The killer here is that these
;;;   functions are n-ary. Handling the general case is quite inefficient,
;;;   requiring many intermediate data structures to be allocated and
;;;   discarded.
;;; - transform applications of procedures that take optional arguments
;;;   into calls to variants that do not take optional arguments. This
;;;   eliminates unnecessary consing and parsing of the rest parameter.
;;;
;;; These transforms would provide BIG speedups. In particular, the n-ary
;;; mapping functions are particularly slow and cons-intensive, and are good
;;; candidates for tuning. I have coded fast paths for the single-list cases,
;;; but what you really want to do is exploit the fact that the compiler
;;; usually knows how many arguments are being passed to a particular
;;; application of these functions -- they are usually explicitly called, not
;;; passed around as higher-order values. If you can arrange to have your
;;; compiler produce custom code or custom linkages based on the number of
;;; arguments in the call, you can speed these functions up a *lot*. But this
;;; kind of compiler technology no longer exists in the Scheme world as far as
;;; I can see.
;;;
;;; Note that this code is, of course, dependent upon standard bindings for
;;; the R5RS procedures -- i.e., it assumes that the variable CAR is bound
;;; to the procedure that takes the car of a list. If your Scheme
;;; implementation allows user code to alter the bindings of these procedures
;;; in a manner that would be visible to these definitions, then there might
;;; be trouble. You could consider horrible kludgery along the lines of
;;;    (define fact
;;;      (let ((= =) (- -) (* *))
;;;        (letrec ((real-fact (lambda (n)
;;;                              (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (real-fact (- n 1)))))))
;;;          real-fact)))
;;; Or you could consider shifting to a reasonable Scheme system that, say,
;;; has a module system protecting code from this kind of lossage.
;;;
;;; This code does a fair amount of run-time argument checking. If your
;;; Scheme system has a sophisticated compiler that can eliminate redundant
;;; error checks, this is no problem. However, if not, these checks incur
;;; some performance overhead -- and, in a safe Scheme implementation, they
;;; are in some sense redundant: if we don't check to see that the PROC
;;; parameter is a procedure, we'll find out anyway three lines later when
;;; we try to call the value. It's pretty easy to rip all this argument
;;; checking code out if it's inappropriate for your implementation -- just
;;; nuke every call to CHECK-ARG.
;;;
;;; On the other hand, if you *do* have a sophisticated compiler that will
;;; actually perform soft-typing and eliminate redundant checks (Rice's systems
;;; being the only possible candidate of which I'm aware), leaving these checks
;;; in can *help*, since their presence can be elided in redundant cases,
;;; and in cases where they are needed, performing the checks early, at
;;; procedure entry, can "lift" a check out of a loop.
;;;
;;; Finally, I have only checked the properties that can portably be checked
;;; with R5RS Scheme -- and this is not complete. You may wish to alter
;;; the CHECK-ARG parameter checks to perform extra, implementation-specific
;;; checks, such as procedure arity for higher-order values.
;;;
;;; The code has only these non-R4RS dependencies:
;;;   A few calls to an ERROR procedure;
;;;   Uses of the R5RS multiple-value procedure VALUES and the m-v binding
;;;     RECEIVE macro (which isn't R5RS, but is a trivial macro).
;;;   Many calls to a parameter-checking procedure check-arg:
;;;    (define (check-arg pred val caller)
;;;      (let lp ((val val))
;;;        (if (pred val) val (lp (error "Bad argument" val pred caller)))))
;;;   A few uses of the LET-OPTIONAL and :OPTIONAL macros for parsing
;;;     optional arguments.
;;;
;;; Most of these procedures use the NULL-LIST? test to trigger the
;;; base case in the inner loop or recursion. The NULL-LIST? function
;;; is defined to be a careful one -- it raises an error if passed a
;;; non-nil, non-pair value. The spec allows an implementation to use
;;; a less-careful implementation that simply defines NULL-LIST? to
;;; be NOT-PAIR?. This would speed up the inner loops of these procedures
;;; at the expense of having them silently accept dotted lists.

;;; A note on dotted lists:
;;; I, personally, take the view that the only consistent view of lists
;;; in Scheme is the view that *everything* is a list -- values such as
;;; 3 or "foo" or 'bar are simply empty dotted lists. This is due to the
;;; fact that Scheme actually has no true list type. It has a pair type,
;;; and there is an *interpretation* of the trees built using this type
;;; as lists.
;;;
;;; I lobbied to have these list-processing procedures hew to this
;;; view, and accept any value as a list argument. I was overwhelmingly
;;; overruled dulistring the SRFI discussion phase. So I am inserting this
;;; text in the reference lib and the SRFI spec as a sort of "minority
;;; opinion" dissent.
;;;
;;; Many of the procedures in this library can be trivially redefined
;;; to handle dotted lists, just by changing the NULL-LIST? base-case
;;; check to NOT-PAIR?, meaning that any non-pair value is taken to be
;;; an empty list. For most of these procedures, that's all that is
;;; required.
;;;
;;; However, we have to do a little more work for some procedures that
;;; *produce* lists from other lists.  Were we to extend these procedures to
;;; accept dotted lists, we would have to define how they terminate the lists
;;; produced as results when passed a dotted list. I designed a coherent set
;;; of termination rules for these cases; this was posted to the SRFI-1
;;; discussion list. I additionally wrote an earlier version of this library
;;; that implemented that spec. It has been discarded during later phases of
;;; the definition and implementation of this library.
;;;
;;; The argument *against* defining these procedures to work on dotted
;;; lists is that dotted lists are the rare, odd case, and that by
;;; arranging for the procedures to handle them, we lose error checking
;;; in the cases where a dotted list is passed by accident -- e.g., when
;;; the programmer swaps a two arguments to a list-processing function,
;;; one being a scalar and one being a list. For example,
;;;     (member '(1 3 5 7 9) 7)
;;; This would quietly return #f if we extended MEMBER to accept dotted
;;; lists.
;;;
;;; The SRFI discussion record contains more discussion on this topic.

 * (null-list? list)
 *
 * |List| is a proper or circular list. This procedure returns true if the argument
 * is the empty list (), and false otherwise. It is an error to pass this procedure
 * a value which is not a proper or circular list.
 *
 * This procedure is recommended as the termination condition for list-processing
 * procedures that are not defined on dotted lists.

<doc EXT list=
 (list= elt= list1 ...)

 * Determines list equality, given an element-equality
 * procedure. Proper list A equals proper list B if they are of the same
 * length, and their corresponding elements are equal, as determined by
 * elt=. If the element-comparison procedure's first argument is from
 * listi, then its second argument is from listi+1, i.e. it is always
 * called as |(elt= a b)| for a an element of list A, and b an element of
 * list B.
 *
 * In the n-ary case, every listi is compared to listi+1 (as opposed,
 * for example, to comparing list1 to every listi, for i>1). If there are
 * no list arguments at all, list= simply returns true.
 *
 * It is an error to apply list= to anything except proper lists. While
 * implementations may choose to extend it to circular lists, note that
 * it cannot reasonably be extended to dotted lists, as it provides no
 * way to specify an equality procedure for comparing the list
 * terminators.
 *
 * Note that the dynamic order in which the elt= procedure is applied
 * to pairs of elements is not specified. For example, if list= is
 * applied to three lists, A, B, and C, it may first completely compare A
 * to B, then compare B to C, or it may compare the first elements of A
 * and B, then the first elements of B and C, then the second elements of
 * A and B, and so forth.
 *
 * The equality procedure must be consistent with eq?. That is, it must be
 * the case that
 * |(eq? x y) => (elt= x y)|.
 *
 * Note that this implies that two lists which are eq? are always
 * |list=|, as well; implementations may exploit this fact to "short-cut"
 * the element-by-element comparisons.

 * @end lisp
 *  or, equivalently,
 * @lisp
 * (reduce-right append '() list-of-lists)
 * @end lisp
 * |concatenate!| is the linear-update variant, defined in terms of |append!|
 * instead of |append|.
 *
 * Note that some Scheme implementations do not support passing more than a certain
 * number (e.g., 64) of arguments to an n-ary procedure. In these implementations,
 * the |(apply append ...)| idiom would fail when applied to long lists, but
 * |concatenate| would continue to function properly.
 *
 * As with |append| and |append!|, the last element of the input list may be any

;;; Fold/map internal utilities
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;; These little internal utilities are used by the general
;;; fold & mapper funs for the n-ary cases . It'd be nice if they got inlined.
;;; One the other hand, the n-ary cases are painfully inefficient as it is.
;;; An aggressive implementation should simply re-write these functions
;;; for raw efficiency; I have written them for as much clarity, portability,
;;; and simplicity as can be achieved.
;;;
;;; I use the dreaded call/cc to do local aborts. A good compiler could
;;; handle this with extreme efficiency. An implementation that provides
;;; a one-shot, non-persistent continuation grabber could help the compiler
;;; out by using that in place of the call/cc's in these routines.
;;;
;;; These functions have funky definitions that are precisely tuned to
;;; the needs of the fold/map procs -- for example, to minimize the number
;;; of times the argument lists need to be examined.

;;; Return (map cdr lists).
;;; However, if any element of LISTS is empty, just abort and return '().

 *         (cons (f seed)
 *               (unfold p f g (g seed))))
 * @end lisp
 *
 *  p        Determines when to stop unfolding.
 *  f        Maps each seed value to the corresponding list element.
 *  g        Maps each seed value to next seed value.
 *  seed     The "state" value for the unfold.
 *  tail-gen Creates the tail of the list; defaults to (lambda (x) '())
 *
 *  In other words, we use g to generate a sequence of seed values
 *  |seed|, |g(seed)|, |g2(seed)|, |g3(seed)|, ...
 *
 * These seed values are mapped to list elements by |f|, producing the
 * elements of the result list in a left-to-right order. |P| says when to
 * stop.
 *
 * |unfold| is the fundamental recursive list constructor, just as
 * |fold-right| is the fundamental recursive list consumer. While |unfold|
 * may seem a bit abstract to novice functional programmers, it can be
 * used in a number of ways:
 * @lisp
 *  ;; List of squares: 1^2 ... 10^2
 *  (unfold (lambda (x) (> x 10))
 *          (lambda (x) (* x x))

 *
 *  ;; Append HEAD onto TAIL:
 *  (unfold null-list? car cdr head
 *                 (lambda (x) tail))
 * @end lisp
 * Interested functional programmers may enjoy noting that |fold-right|
 * and unfold are in some sense inverses. That is, given operations
 * |knull?|, |kar|, |kdr|, |kons|, and |knil| satisfying
 * @lisp
 * (kons (kar x) (kdr x)) = x and (knull? knil) = #t
 * @end lisp

 * (delete-duplicates  list [=])
 * (delete-duplicates! list [=])
 *
 * |Delete-duplicates| removes duplicate elements from the |list|
 * argument. If there are multiple equal elements in the argument |list|,
 * the result list only contains the first or leftmost of these elements
 * in the result. The order of these surviving elements is the same as in
 * the original list -- delete-duplicates does not disorder the
 * list (hence it is useful for "cleaning up" association lists).
 *
 * The |=| parameter is used to compare the elements of the list; it
 * defaults to |equal?|. If |x| comes before |y| in list, then the comparison
 * is performed |(= x y)|. The comparison procedure will be used to compare
 * each pair of elements in list no more than once; the order in which it
 * is applied to the various pairs is not specified.
 *
 * Implementations of |delete-duplicates| are allowed to share common
 * tails between argument and result lists -- for example, if the list
 * argument contains only unique elements, it may simply return exactly
 * this list.
 *
 * The STklos implementation of |delete-duplicates| uses an element-marking
 * strategy and hence runs in linear time.
 *
 * |delete-duplicates!| is the linear-update variant of
 * |delete-duplicates|; it is allowed, but not required, to alter the cons
 * cells in its argument list to construct the result.
 * @lisp
 * (delete-duplicates '(a b a c a b c z)) => (a b c z)

 * (delete-duplicates '((a . 3) (b . 7) (a . 9) (c . 1))

;;; The reference implementaiton of SRFI-1 has the following caveat:

;;;;; Beware -- these are N^2 algorithms. To efficiently remove duplicates
;;;;; in long lists, sort the list to bring duplicates together, then use a
;;;;; linear-time algorithm to kill the dups. Or use an algorithm based on
;;;;; element-marking. The former gives you O(n lg n), the latter is linear.
;;;
;;; We have implemented a simple element-marking approach using hash tables,
;;; and it is consistently faster for lists of size larger than 10.
;;; It does require more space, since besides the list being build we also
;;; keep a hash table as large as the set of elements, but the difference
