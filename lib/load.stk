 * (find-path str path)
 * (find-path str path suffixes)
 *
 * In its first form, |find-path| returns the path name of the file
 * that should be loaded by the procedure  |load| given the name |str|.
 * The string returned depends of the current  load path and of the
 * currently accepted suffixes.
 * @l
 * The other forms of |find-path| are more general and allow to give a path
 * list (a list of strings representing supposed directories) and a set
 * of suffixes (given as a list of strings too) to try for finding a file.
 * If no file is found, |find-path| returns `#f`.
 * @l
 * For instance, on a "classical" Unix box:
 * @lisp
 * (find-path "passwd" '("/bin" "/etc" "/tmp"))
 *             => "/etc/passwd"
 * (find-path "stdio" '("/usr" "/usr/include") '("c" "h" "stk"))

<doc EXT-SYNTAX autoload
 * (autoload spec symbol ...)
 *
 * This form is similar to the Emacs |autoload| macro: it registers the existence
 * of a function, but postpones the loading of the file or the importation of the
 * library that defines it. The  first call to the function automatically loads,
 * or imports, the proper library, in order to install the real definition and
 * other associated code, then runs the real definition as if it had been loaded
 * all along. The specifier |spec| may be:
 *
 * - a string which denotes the file which will be required (with |require| form)
 * before calling the
 * function denoted by |symbol|.
 * - a {{rseven}} library name denoting the library that must be imported in order to
 * the function denoted by |symbol|.
 *
 * @lisp
 * (autoload (scheme list) iota take)
 * (autoload "utils" cube fact fib)
 * @end lisp
 *
 * With the first |autoload|, the first call of |iota| or |take| will automatically
 * import the Scheme library |(scheme list)|.
 * In the second call, the file "utils" will be required before calling, for the
 * first time,  |cube|, |fact| or |fib|.
 *
 * [NOTE]
 * ====
 * - If |spec| is a string, the corresponding |provide| must be present in the file
 * denoted by |spec|.
 * - To avoid an infinite loop, the symbols specified in the |autoload| must be
 * defined in the file or library given in |spec|.
 * - When |spec| denotes a library, the imporation is limited only to the symbol
 * which trigger this importation.
 * - For now, the symbols specified in the |atoload| form cannot denote a syntax name.
