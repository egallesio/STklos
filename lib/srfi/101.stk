;;;; The real implementation is in (scheme rlist).

;; HACK:
;; We will not do
;; (%make-copy-module scheme/rlist srfi/101)
;; because this seems to load the module, and we will not be able to use
;; the original CAR, QUOTE, LIST, CONS, etc.
;; Instead we mimic what %make-copy-module would do:

(define-module srfi/101
  (import scheme/rlist)
  (export <rlist>
          linear-access-list->random-access-list
          random-access-list->linear-access-list
          for-each map
          list-ref/update
          list-set
          list-ref
          list-tail
          reverse
          append
          length
          make-list
          list
          list?
          null?
          cdddar cddddr cddadr cddaar cdadar cdaddr cdaadr
          cdaaar caddar cadddr cadadr cadaar caadar caaddr
          caaadr caaaar cddar cdddr cdadr cdaar cadar caddr
          caadr caaar cdar cddr cadr caar cdr car
          cons
          pair?
          quote))

(provide "srfi/101")
