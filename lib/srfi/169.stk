(define-module srfi/169)

;; STklos has this parameter set to #t by default. However...
;; If the user turned it off, and then decided to "load SRFI 169",
;; perhaps by the principle of least surprise, we should turn
;; it back on (because having loaded the SRFI we'd expect it to
;; work from now on...)
(accept-srfi-169-numbers #t)

(provide "srfi/169")
