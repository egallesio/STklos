// Readline interface for completion
//
// When using completion we need some variables and functions from
// "readline/readline.h". However, since we don't use autoconf for locating the
// installation directory of readline (or libedit), we just declare what we need
// here. It also permits to compile this file without libreadline or libedit.
//
// NOTE: STklos does not try to link the GNU readline library since on BSD
// systems, it is generally not present (plus the complex interaction of LGPL
// and GPL). Hence, autoconf doesn't try to locate any editing library and
// the REPL just tries to link against a line editing library at runtime if it
// finds one.
