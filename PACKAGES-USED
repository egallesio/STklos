STklos uses some libraries developped by other people.
These libraries are:


GMP: The Gnu MP library
=======================
If you have a version of GMP installed, it will be used. Otherwise,
STklos uses a stripped down version of GMP (called mini-gmp) which is
included in the main GMP distribution. Only the source of the mini-gmp
directory is provided here, to avoid the copy of full GMP (which is
quite large). Note however that mini-gmp is far less efficient than
the full version counterpart.

  - Version: 6.3.0 (the mini-gmp included in it)

used if there are no identical (or higher) versions of these libraries
already installed on the system at configuration time.
