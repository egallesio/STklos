* THINGS TO DO (BY CATEGORY)

** R5RS STUFF
Some things need to be done to be fully R5RS

 - eval must take the second parameter sepcified in R5RS. Our version is
 more general, but some tuning must be done
 - Transcripts


**  STUFF TO PORT FROM STK
 - Implement the virtual ports of STk
 - when-port-readable ...
 - ...


** COMPILER
 - Add goto optimisations
 - better handling of undefined symbols when compiling a module.

** MISC
 - Use packages in all the library to hide functions which should not be 
 exported. Use a scheme similar to STk, such as if a user redefines a 
 standard function, it will not break the library itself.
 - Make an interactive help command. Everything is ready for that.
