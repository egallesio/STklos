	* This version uses now the mini-gmp implementation (a small
	one-file version of the real GMP library). It replaces the
	previous version which was a wrapper around the MPI library
	developed by Michael J. Fromberger

	* This is a GMPlite version.
	  This version is built for STklos from the transitive closure of the
	  functions used in src/numbers.c
	  This version is used if there is no GMP library installed on the
	  system at configure time (otherwise the system GMP is used).
