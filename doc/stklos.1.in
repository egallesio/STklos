.SH NAME
stklos \- An efficient Scheme System providing a powerful Object
System

.SH SYNOPSYS
\fbstklos\fR [OPTION ...] [ARGUMENT ... ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B STklos
is a free Scheme System (nearly) conform to R5RS. The aim of this
implementation is to be fast as well as light. The implementation is
based on an ad-hoc Virtual Machine. 
.B STklos 
can also be compiled as a library, so that one can easily embed it 
in an application.
.LP
The salient points of STklos are:
.IP "" 4
- efficient and powerful object system based on CLOS providing:
.IP "" 8
+ Multiple Inheritance,
.IP "" 8
+ Generic Functions,
.IP "" 8
+ Multi-methods
.IP "" 8
+ an efficient MOP (Meta Object Protocol)
.IP "" 4
- a simple to use module system
.IP "" 4
- implemanents the full tower of numbers defined in R5RS
.IP "" 4
- easy connection to the GTK+ toolkit
.IP "" 4
- Perl compatible regular expressions thanks to the PCRE package.
.IP "" 4
- tail recursive calls are properly implemented

.SH OPTIONS
Here are the options available in the version @VERSION@ of 
.B stklos.

.IP "-l file, --load=file"
load 'file' before going interactive
.IP "-f file, --file=file"
use 'file' as program
.IP "-e sexpr, --execute=sexpr"
evaluate the given sexpr and exit
.IP "-b file, --boot-file=file"
use 'file' to boot the system instead of the default one
.IP "-D directory, --conf-dir=directory"
use the given directory to store the various configuration files. This
directory is also used to store the packages installed with the
\fIstklos-pkg(1)\fR command. Note that the shell variable
\fISTKLOS_CONFDIR\fR can also be used to set this directory (see below).
.IP "-q, --no-init-file"
quiet: do not load the user init file
.IP "-i, --interactive"
be interactive, even if the command finds it is not the case. This
option is generally useful when used inside emacs since it permits to
display the REPL prompts.
.IP "-n, --no-line-editor"
tell the REPL to not use the line editor even if GNU readline or BSD
libedit libraries are found. This permit to use an external tool such 
as rlwrap(1) instead of the internal line editor support.
.IP "-d, --debug"
insert informations to ease debugging (e.g, line numbers, signaling
usage of undefined symbols, ...). Can be used multiple times to
increase the debugging level;
.IP "-s, --stack-size=n"
use a stack of \fBn\fR cells.
.IP "-c, --case-sensitive"
be case sensitive. The default is to be case insensitive as specified
by R5RS.
.IP "-v, --version"
print program version and exit
.IP "-h, --help"
print this help and exit
.IP "--"
This special option signals the end of the \fBstklos\fR command. The
arguments placed after this option are taken program arguments, 
even if they start with a "-" character.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

.IP "STKLOS_LOAD_PATH"
This is a colon-separated list of directories in which \fBstklos\fR
looks for loading files. It is used by functions such as \fBload\fR
or \fBtry-load\fR.

.IP "STKLOS_FRAMES"
This variable must contains an integer which indicates the number of
frames printed on an error. Use the value \fB0\fR for an unlimited
back-trace.

.IP "STKLOS_CONFDIR"
This variable can be used to designate the directory used by \fBstklos\fR 
to store its configuration or packages files. It not set, the default 
\fBstklos\fR configuration directory is by default \fB~/.stklos\fR.

.SH FILES

.IP "~/<stklos-conf-dir>/stklosrc" 
This file is the user init file which is loaded when \fBstklos\fR
starts. Use the \fB-q\fR to avoid the loading of this file.
