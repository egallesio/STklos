{{chapter "Foreign Function Interface"}}
(((FFI)))

The {{stklos}} Foreign Function Interface (FFI for short) has been
defined to allow an easy access to functions written in C without
needing to build C-wrappers and, consequently, without any need to
write C code.  FFI is very machine dependent and {{stklos}} uses the
https://sourceware.org/libffi/[*libffi library*], a portable Foreign Function
Interface library, to give access to C written code.
This library supports a large set of architectures/OS that are
described on its Home Page.

Moreover, since FFI allows very low level access, it is easy to crash
the {{stklos}} VM when using an external C function.

*Note that the support for FFI is still minimal and that it will
evolve in future versions.*


### External functions


The definition of an external function is done with the
`define-external` special form.  This form takes as arguments
a typed list of parameters and accepts several options to define the
name of the function in the C world, the library which defines this
function, ... The type of the function result and the type of its
arguments are defined in <<ffi_types>>. This table lists
the various keywords reserved for denoting types and their equivalence
between the C and the Scheme worlds.

|====

NOTE: **About `:char`, `:schar` and `:uchar`**: +
When the value comes from Scheme,
it can be either an integer or a character. When the value is read back from
C, the value is always returned as an integer. This is because a character can
be used as a small integer in C (possibly signed) and that its value may be an
incorrect Scheme character.


{{insertdoc 'define-external}}

Hereafter, are some commented definitions of external functions:


```scheme
 (define-external isatty ((fd :int))
     :return-type :boolean)

  (define-external system ((cmd :string))
    :return-type :int)

  (define-external ttyname (:int)
    :return-type :string)
```

All these functions are defined in the C standard library, hence it is not
necessary to specify the `:library-name` option.



* *_istty_* is declared here as a function which takes an
  integer and returns a boolean (in fact, the value returned by the
  C function *_isatty_* is an *_int_*, but we ask here to the FFI
  system to translate this result as a boolean value in the Scheme
  world).
* *_system_* is a function which takes a string as parameter
  and returns an *_int_*.
* *_ttyname_* is a function whih takes an int and returns a string.
  Note that in this function the name of the parameter has been omitted
  as within C prototypes.

If an external function receives an `:int` argument and is passed a
Scheme bignum, which then doesn't fit a *_long int_* in C, the
external function will signal an error. When a `:float` or `:double`
argument is declared and is passed a Scheme real that requires so many
bits so as to not be representable in that type, that argument will be
silently taken as infinity.

```scheme
 (define-external c-abs ((fd :int))
     :entry-name "abs"
     :return-type :int)

 (define-external c-fabs ((fd :double))
     :entry-name "fabs"
     :return-type :double)

 (define-external c-fabsf ((fd :float))
     :entry-name "fabsf"
     :return-type :float)
```

We can now use the function we have just defined:

```scheme
(c-abs (- (expt 2 70)))    => Error
(c-fabs -1.0e+250)         => 1e+250
(c-fabsf -1.0e+250)        => +inf.0
(c-fabs (- (expt 10 300))) => 1e+300
(c-fabs (- (expt 10 600))) => +inf.0
```


In the following example we use the `:string` type. C functions accepting
pointers to null-terminated strings are directly translated to this type.

The POSIX function `strpbrk` accepts two string arguments (in C, two
pointers to `char`). The C call `strpbrk(str1, str2)` returns a
pointer to the first occurrence in the string `str1` of one of the
bytes in the string `str2`.

```scheme
(define-external c-strpbrk ((str :string) (accept :string))
    :entry-name "strpbrk"
    :return-type :string)
```

```scheme
(c-strpbrk "a string" "rz") => "ring"
```

Note that it would be possible to use a `:pointer` type instead for the return
value, although in this case it would be more cumbersome (but does help understand
the FFI better!):

```scheme
(define-external c-strpbrk ((str :string) (accept :string))
    :entry-name "strpbrk"
    :return-type :pointer)
```

```scheme
(c-strpbrk "a string" "rz")
                            => #[C-pointer 7f17baf94d06 @ 7f17bafb4360]
(cpointer->string (c-strpbrk "a string" "rz"))
                            => "ring"
```

In order to pass a `NULL` pointer to an external C function, the
`#void` Scheme value can be used.

As an example, the second argument to the `strtol` function can be
`NULL`:

```scheme
(define-external strtol(:string :pointer :int)
  :return-type :long)
```

```scheme
(strtol "1001" #void 10) => 1001
(strtol "1001" #void 2)  => 9
```

Functions on C pointers are described in the next section.

### C pointers

It is very common that external functions return pointers, serving as
handles on internal structures. This pointers, called hereafter
*cpointers*, are then boxed in a Scheme objects. This section presents
the functions that can be used to deal with C pointers.


WARNING: Note that by using *cpointers* objects, one gives up the safety of
the Scheme environment, and care must be taken to avoid memory corruptions,
errors, crashes...
