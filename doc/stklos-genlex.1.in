.SH NAME
stklos-genlex \- lexical analyzer generation for STklos

.SH SYNOPSIS
stklos-genlex lex-file output-file constructor
.LP
stklos-genlex source-file output-file

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B stklos-genlex
can be used to make  lexical analyzers with
.B STklos.
It is a simple front-end to the Danny Dubé
.B SILex
tool.

.PP
When this command is called with three parameters, it takes
a standard SILex input file as input and generate an analyzer.
These parameters are described below:
.IP "\fIlex-file\fR"
is the input file which contains the lex-like rules describing the
analyzer to be built

.IP "\fRoutput-file\fI"
is a file which will contain the Scheme analyzer produced by the
\fBSILex\fR tool.

.IP "\fIconstructor\fR"
is the name of the procedure that will be produced in the
\fIoutput-file\fR . This procedure takes one parameter which is the
file name (or the port) which is used as the input stream for the
lexical analyzer. The value returned by this procedure is a STklos
object which contains the automaton. To fetch the next token of the
input stream, programs must use the \fIlexer-next-token\fR. procedure.
See the example below for details.

.PP
Another usage of the \fBstklos-genlex\fR can be to use the
\fIdefine-regular-grammar\fR special form directly in a source
file. This form takes the name of the analyzer, the arguments which are
passed to the analyzer, the macros part and rules part of the
analyzer. In this case,  \fBstklos-genlex\fR is called with the source
file and the name of the output file. The output file, will contain
a copy of the source file where the \fIdefine-regular-grammar\fR  have
been replaced by the code of the analyzer.

.SH "EXAMPLE"

Suppose that the lexical rules are in the file \fIrules.l\fR. One can
built an analyzer in the file \fIout.stk\fRfor this rules using the
following command
.nf
     stklos-genlex  rules.l out.stk my-make-lex
.fi
The following piece of code show how to use the produced analyzer.
.nf
      (load "out.stk")
      ...
      (let ((lex (my-make-lex "foo")))
	;; Display the first token of file foo
	(display (lexer-next-token lex))
	...)
.fi
.PP
This example uses the second form of  \fBstklos-genlex\fR
usage. Here is an analyzer which skips lines starting with
2 slashes. Suppose that we have a file \fIlex.stk\fR which is:
.nf
(define-regular-grammar skip-//-lines
  ;; The arguments
  ()
  ;; The macros
  #<<%EOM
space [ \\9]
eol   \\n
%EOM
  ;; The grammar
  #<<%EOG
{space}*//.*{eol}       (yycontinue)
^.*{eol}                yytext
<<EOF>>                 (eof-object)
<<ERROR>>               (error "invalid token")
%EOG
)

(define (copy in out)
  (let ((reader (make-regular-reader skip-//-lines in)))
    (let loop ((line (reader)))
      (unless (eof-object? line)
	(display line out)
	(loop (reader))))))
.fi

The following command will produce an analyzer in file \fIana.stk\fR
.nf
     stklos-genlex  lex.stk ana.stk
.fi
