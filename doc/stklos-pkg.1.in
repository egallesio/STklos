.SH NAME
stklos-pkg \- ScmPkg packages management

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fbstklos-pkg\fR [\fIoptions\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B stklos-pkg
command is the general tool for downloading, installing and  uninstalling
.B ScmPkg 
packages in STklos. 
.LP
The first time you use stklos-pkg you must synchronize your local
repository with the ScmPkg server. This is done using the
\fI--setup\fR option. The other options of stklos-pkg are described 
below. 

.SH OPTIONS
Here are the options available in the version @VERSION@ of 
.B stklos.

.IP "--extract package | -e package" 
extract the files of  \fIpackage\fR (and all its dependencies) and build a
Unix Makefile for compiling the package. The files are extracted in the
directory specified with option \fI--directory\fR (or the current
directory if the option is unused. The generated Makefile offers the
following targets: 
.RS
.IP  "all" 
to build the package dependencies nd the package itself
.IP "test" 
to run package tests
.IP "install" 
to install the package (and its dependencies) for the current user
.IP "   system-install" 
to install the package (and its dependencies) system-wide 
.RE

.IP "--test=package | -t package"
extract and test the given package in a temporary directory. If the 
test succeeds, the \fIstklos-pkg\fR command returns 0. 

.IP "--install=package| -i package"
install the given package and its dependencies in the standard
installation directory. If the \fI--system-wide\fR flag is not used, files
are installed in the user directory. Otherwise, files are installed in 
a shared directory available to all users. 

.IP "--uninstall package"
un-install the files which were copied during the installation of the
given package. Use the \fI--system-wide\fR option to un-install shared files.

.IP "--sync | -s"

download the description of all the packages which are available on 
the server(s). The packages themselves are downloaded, only when
needed. 

.IP "--add=package| -a package"
adds the given package to the repository. 

.IP "--fill-cache" 
downloads all the package which are available on the server(s). This
can be used for copying all remote packages, when the net connection

files take too much place. Packages will be downloaded when needed
