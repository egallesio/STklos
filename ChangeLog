	complete hierarchy

2006-09-04  Erick Gallesio  <eg@essi.fr>

	* lib/r5rs.stk (%make-with-file): The file name in error messages 
	was incorrect.

	* src/process.c: PROCESS-EXIT-STATUS was not exported.

2006-08-04  Erick Gallesio  <eg@essi.fr>

	* src/lib.c: Deletedthe managemement of the STk_library_path
	variable which was not used anymore

2006-06-20  Erick Gallesio  <eg@essi.fr>

	assignments

2006-05-26  Erick Gallesio  <eg@essi.fr>

	* src/thread-pthreads.c (thread-terminate!): Fixed a deadlock problem.

	* src/thread-*: defined the STk_thread_abstime_to_reltime in the 
	common part. Used it for pthreads and lurc.

	* src/thread-pthreads.c: Corrected thread-sleep!

2006-04-25  Erick Gallesio  <eg@essi.fr>

	* src/error.c: Code Factorization of STk_error and STk_make_error

2006-04-21  separdau  <separdau@localhost>

	* src/thread-pthreads.c:
	Fix a bug I think, since a thread_obj is always == to its
	vm->scheme_thread field.
	[6c653e49de75] [tip]

	* src/mutex-lurc.c:
	And the same dull insane-driving error handling in mutex-lurc
	[524410e6f0aa]

	* src/thread-pthreads.c, src/thread-pthreads.h, src/error.c: 
	added a function to create an error like STk_error but
	without raising it (it returns it). There is a lot of code
	duplication but I didn't know how to use it from STk_error because
	of the ... argument. 

	* all_threads: renamed _specific to sys_(sys_thread,sys_mutex,sys_condv) 
	for code and data which are specific to a thread system. 
	The _specific was confusing with TLS specific.

	errors.

	extern, and also declare its associated primitive_obj as extern.

	* vm.c: fix (??) REG_CALL_PRIM which was doing some real wrong stuff I
	have no idead why it worked, and if it did work, no idea why it
	still works after my fix... 
	[7db9abfc564b]

2006-04-18  separdau  <separdau@localhost>

	* configure.in: removed REENTRANT and GC_LINUX_THREADS for Lurc, I'm
	still not sure this does the right thing, especially when giving it
	to the GC we're builing, which should not happen (I think).

	* lib/thread.stk: this one got removed (by accident?) and since the
	Makefile called it thread.stk (and not thread_S_.stk) I renamed
	it... fixme ? 

	* thread*: remove threads from all_threads when they
	terminate, I think it's a good time then, but for the pthreads impl
	there are a few mutex and condv destroy missing... 

	* lurc-*: made threads, mutexes and cond vars accept any SCM obj 
	as name lurc-

	* thread.c: fixed a bug in thread_join for already dead threads now
	make test passes !!!
	[8c0840e4f538]

	exit functions are executed.

	* utils/stklos-config.in: Added the option --threads to know what
	thread system is compiled in. 
	

2006-04-14 Stephane Epardaud <Stephane.Epardaud@sophia.inria.fr>

	be assocaited to a thread. PARAMETERIZE permits to have a thread
	specific dynamic environment.
	
	* src/env.c: CURRENT-MODULE is now thread sepcific

2006-04-05  Erick Gallesio  <eg@essi.fr>
n

	Wolpert for signalling the bug. 

2005-05-25  Erick Gallesio  <eg@essi.fr>

	    for "-c" users). 

2005-05-13  Erick Gallesio  <eg@essi.fr>

	* src/vm.c (run_vm): Fixed a bug with multiple values. Sometimes

	* lib/repl.stk: New primitive REPL.

	* src/fport.c (fill_buffer): Clear the EOF flag to allow mutiple

	* src/socket.c (set_socket_io_ports): A port was allocated and
	never closed, leading to file descriptor leaks. Fixed.

2005-04-07  Erick Gallesio  <eg@essi.fr>

	* lib/make-C-boot.stk: New file used when a new boot file is
	created. It translates the boot file in C data which can be used

	* lib/object.stk: Correction of a long standing annoyance: when

	compiling a file, the final expansion of the method was done 
	when the compiled file was loaded (hence, the message about

	incorrect.

2003-07-29  Erick Gallesio  <eg@essi.fr>

	* src/read.c (read_rec): The reader recognizes now the DSSSL
	keywords #!key, #!optional and #!rest. They are converted to the 
	STklos keywords :key :optional and :rest respectively. Otherwise, 
	the sequence #! is always considered as a one line comment.
	

2003-07-06  Erick Gallesio  <eg@essi.fr>

	documentation index

	displayed by describe.

	* lib/object.stk (compute-get-n-set): Added STk active slots. They
	are in the standard <class> meta-class instead of the
	<active-metaclass> as it was the case in STk. Consequently there 
	is no more the need of including a file and to define a metaclass

	* lib/object.stk ((%compute-slots C)): Slots are sorted such that
	instance slots are always before other slots. So, virtual slots
	are fist and, for instance, virtual slots can have an initial
	value which depends of real slots.

2001-07-23  Erick Gallesio  <eg@unice.fr>
