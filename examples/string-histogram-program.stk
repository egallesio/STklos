;;; The file "srting-histogram.stk" must be in the same directory as this,
;;; so it will be automatically loaded. If not, then one needs to adjust the
;;; load-path parameter to include the directory where the library implementation
;;; is.

;;; How to use this:
;;;
;;; stklos -f string-histgram-program.stk
;;;
;;; OR just start STklos and load this from the REPL:
;;;
;;; stklos> (load "string-histogram-program.stk")
;;;
;;; OR, after compiling, execute it:
;;;
;;; stklos-compile -o string-histogram.ostk string-histogram.stk
;;; stklos-compile -o string-histogram-program string-histogram-program.stk
;;; ./string-histogram-program
