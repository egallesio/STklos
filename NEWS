* version 0.71 (2005 11 03)

    * Added virtual ports (ports defined by user functions)
    * The reader accepts now #eof to denote the eend of file object
    * Fix problems with SunOS support
    * Fix problems with gcc4 compilation
    * Hash tables are now compliant to SRFI-69 (Basic Hash Tables). 
      This implies some (compatible) changes in the hash-tables
      function names.
    * New primitives
          o finite?
          o infinite?
          o unsetenv!
          o file-size
    * New implemented SRFIs
          o SRFI-62 (S-expression comments)

          o SRFI-70 (Numbers)
    * Bug fixes

* version 0.70 (2005 05 27)  

    The main changes in this release are: a new back-trace system, a
    conform call/cc/dynamic-wind implementation and some performance
    enhancements.                                                    
    * Added a way to have a back-trace when an error occurs
    * call/cc has been completely implemented. Its interaction with
      dynamic-wind is now conform to R5RS.                         
    * Perfomance improvements
    * Added some infrastructure for auto-testing a newly built system.
    * New primitives
	 + port-rewind
	 + port-seek  
	 + current-loading-file
	 + decode-float
	 + read/ss
	 + write/ss
	 + repl
    * Multiple EOF can be seen now on an input file to allow staged
      REPLs
    * Added the configure options --with-provided-gc and
      --with-provided-regexp to force the usage of our GC and PCRE
      versions, even if there are some version already installed on
      the system
    * The boot file is now integrated in the VM instead of being read
      from a file. This enhances the loading time of the interpreter
      a bit.
    * Describe shows more information for structures types and
      conditions.
    * The object system takes now into account conditions and
      conditions types

    	    now in generalized set! SRFI-17 (Generalized set!)
