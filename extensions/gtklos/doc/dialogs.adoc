== Dialog box widgets

A dialog box is a graphical interface component consisting of a window displayed by a program  for:

- inform the user of an event, or
 - obtain user information.

{{class-doc "dialog"}}
=== Class <dialog>

A `<dialog>` is a a window split vertically. The top section is the
place where widgets such as a label or an entry should be packed. The
bottom area is generally used for packing buttons into the dialog
which may perform functions such as cancel, ok, or apply.

{{show-class-table <dialog>}}

Methods::

- *container-add!* permits to add a widget to the top area of the
   dialog window (above the buttons).

[#dialog-run]
- *dialog-run* is a function that must be run to wait the user response. When
   the user chooses a button, the string associated to this button is returned
   as result. If the user clicks the close button, the value returned is `#f`.

[#dialog-realize]
- *realize-widget* permits to specify at creation time the buttons used by the
   dialog with the `:buttons` valued parameter. the default buttons are a "OK
   and " and "Cancel" buttons.  The specified value can be the name of a GTK
   stock item and an icon will be associated to the text.  For instance
   "gtk-ok" will add a button with text "Ok" and a check. So the default value
   for the `:buttons` parameter is the list `("gtk-ok" "gtk-cancel")`. See
   official GTK documentation for the possible names for GTK stock
   items. *Note that the usage of GTK stock items is now deprecated*. You can
   also {{see-realize}}.

Exemple::

[source,scheme]
----
(let ((d (make <dialog> :width 300 :title "Testing dialog")))
  ;; Add two labels to this dialog
  (container-add! d (make <label>
                      :text "\nI'm a <b>dialog</b>"))
  (container-add! d (make <label>
                      :text "\nAs you see, we can use bold in labels\n"))

  (let ((res (dialog-run d)))
    (if res
        (eprintf "You clicked the button ~s\n" res)
        (eprintf "Dialog box was closed by the user\n"))
    (destroy d)))
----

Executing the previous code will create the following window:

The make-simple-message-dialog procedure::

The `make-simple-message-dialog` permits to easily build dialog window. It
takes three mandatory parameters.

1. the title of the dialog window
2. the type of the dialog. It is a symbol and can be `error`, `info`
`password`, `question`, `warning`.
3. the message that must be displayed in above the buttons

The following parameters are also accepted:

- *buttons* is a list of buttons (by default, this list contain a OK and
   Cancel buttons).
- *width* the width of the dialog window (default 300)
- *height* the height of the dialog window (default 100)


This procedure also runs the dialog, and waits for the user response. The result is
the name of the clicked button (or ``#f` is destroyed). See below:

[source, scheme]
----
(make-simple-message-dialog "A test" 'question "Are you ready?"
                             :buttons '("gtk-yes" "gtk-no"))

----

Executing the previous code will create the following window, and wait until
the user responds. When execution continues, the result will be `"gtk-yes"`,
`"gtk-no"` of `#f`
