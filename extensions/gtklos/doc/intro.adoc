== Introduction

This extension permits to easily program GUI (Graphical User Interfaces) using
the OO model of _STklos_. The model used here, is very similar to the one
originally defined in https://conservatory.scheme.org/stk/[STk Scheme] and is
discussed in the papers
image:
- https://www.gallesio.org/Publis/jfp03.pdf[Programming
Graphical User Interfaces with Scheme], and in
- https://www.gallesio.org/Publis/Isotas96.pdf[Designing a Meta Object Protocol
to wrap a Standard Graphical Toolkit].

Furthermore, this OO model allows you to define your own widgets thanks to the
MOP (Meta Object Protocol) of _STklos_.

=== Installation

The extension is in the `+extensions/gtklos+` directory of _STklos_. It
is configured when you run `+configure+` in the main directory of
_STklos_. So, to compile it you just need to run

[source,bash]
----
$ make
----

The `+demos+` directory contains several demos that can be run separately or
with the `+run-demos+` script in this directory. Running this script, with

[source,bash]
----
$ cd demos
$ ./run-demos
----

you should obtain something like:

image::images/demos-main.png[images/demos-main,align="center"]

If everything is correct, you can install the _GTklos_ extension with a
`+make install+` in the `+gtklos+` directory. Everything will be
installed in a sub-directory of the main _STklos_ installation

=== Getting started

To use the _GTklos_ extension you need to import the `+(stklos gtklos)+`
library. This can be done with:

[source,scheme]
----
;; Import GTKlos to access its exported symbols
(import (stklos gtklos))
----

==== A first window

The first thing you must do to make an interface consists to create an
instance of the class `+<window>+`. For instance,

[source,scheme]
----
stklos> {{do* (define w (make <window> #:title "A first window"))}}
----

will create a window with a title set to `+"A first window"+`. You can
see all the slots that can be set in `+w+` by using describe:

[source,scheme]
----
stklos> {{do* (describe w)}}
stklos>
----

indexterm:[start-interactive-gtk _function_]
indexterm:[gtk-main _function_]
Now that the window is created, we need to start the GTK+ interaction
loop to see it effectively on our screen. This can be done by calling

- `+(start-interactive-gtk)+`, or
- `+(gtk-main)+`

As said by its name, the fist form is preferred when we create an interface
interactively in the REPL. This form, call the GTK+ event loop when your
keyboard is idle. The second form is generally used when you create a script
and don't use the REPL.

As we can see, the _width_ and the _height_ of this window are reflected in
the `+width+` and `+height+` of `+w+`. Hereafter, are some manipulation with
the width of `+w+`:

[source,scheme]
----
;; Use start-interactive-gtk to develop in the REPL
stklos> (start-interactive-gtk)
;; Setting the width to 400
stklos> (slot-set! w 'width 400)
;; Reading back the value
stklos> (slot-ref w 'width)
400
;; Since accessors are defined on all slots we can also do
stklos> (width w)
400
stklos> (set! (width w) 300)
stklos> (width w)
300
----

Of course, we can also define the widget size at creation time with a
class such as

[source,scheme]
----
stklos> (define w (make <window> #:title "STklos window"
                                 #:width 400
                                 #:height 100))
----

==== Adding a button

We can add a button to a the previous window bay making an instance of a
`+<button>+`:

[source,scheme]
----
{{do* (define b (make <button> #:parent w #:text "A button"))}}
----

By saying that the parent of `+b+` is `+w+`, the window we have just
created just before, this button will be _inside_ the `+w+` window. So,
we will obtain:

image::images/simple-button.png[images/simple-button,align="center"]

Using describe, on `+b+` we have:

[source,scheme]
----
stklos> {{do* (describe b)}}
stklos>
----

The slot `+command+` is particularly important on buttons. It contains the
callback function that will be called when we click (with left mouse button)
on `+b+`. The function will be called with two parameters the widget which
has been clicked and an event object which contains all the information on
the event itself (more on that in <<command_slot>>).

We can add a _command_ to the previous button with:

[source,scheme]
----
stklos> (set! (command b)
              (lambda (w e)
                (printf "Button ~s was clicked\n" w)))
----

Now, when clicking the button `+b+` a message will be printed.

This ends this small introduction on GTKlos.
