[#Events]
== Signal and Events

When a user interacts with a GTklos with an input device (e.g. moves a
mouse or presses a key on the keyboard), GTK receives events from the
windowing system.  Those events are generally directed to a widget
(the area under the pointer mouse for mouse events or the focused
widget for a keyboard event). For more information on GTK events you
can see https://docs.gtk.org/gtk3/input-handling.html[_The GTK Input
and Event Handling Model_] chapter in GTK documentation.


=== Event primitives

The GTklos {{stklos}} extension defines a new object type called
_GTK-event_ to handle events. Some primitives are also defined.


// ----------------------------------------------------------------------
{{primitive-doc '(get-gtk-event) "_STklos_ procedure"}}

This function returns a new _GTK-event_ object representing the event
currently processed by GTK. If no event is processed this function returns
`#f`


// ----------------------------------------------------------------------
{{primitive-doc '(event-type ev) "_STklos_ procedure"}}

GTK events can have different types, depending of the event occuring
on a GTklos widget. The function `event-type` returns an information
on the type of the event as a symbol. The possible values returned by
this function can be one of the following symbols:

|====================
| NOTHING       | DELETE                | DESTROY               | EXPOSE
| MOTION        | BUTTON-PRESS          | BUTTON-RELEASE        | KEY-PRESS
| KEY-RELEASE   | ENTER                 | LEAVE                 | FOCUS-IN
| FOCUS-OUT     | CONFIGURE             | MAP                   | UNMAP
| PROPERTY      | SELECTION-CLEAR       | SELECTION-REQUEST     | SELECTION-NOTIFY
| PROXIMITY-IN  | PROXIMITY-OUT         | DRAG-ENTER            | DRAG-LEAVE
| DRAG-MOTION   | DRAG-STATUS           | DROP-START            | DROP-FINISHED
| CLIENT-EVENT  | VISIBILITY            |                       |
|====================

See GTK documentation for more information.

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------
{{primitive-doc '(event-x ev) "_STklos_ procedure"}}

The primitive `event-x` returns the event window relative x
coordinates from the `ev` event. It returns `#f` if the the given
event does not contain such a coordinate.

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------
{{primitive-doc '(event-y ev) "_STklos_ procedure"}}

The primitive `event-y` returns the event window relative y
coordinates from the `ev` event.It returns `#f` if the the given
event does not contain such a coordinate.

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------
{{primitive-doc '(event-char ev) "_STklos_ procedure"}}

The primitive `event-char` returns the character associated to the event `ev`
if it is a key press or key release event (the result is a Scheme
character). If a key is not pressed or released, the function returns `#f`.


// ----------------------------------------------------------------------
{{primitive-doc '(event-keyval ev) "_STklos_ procedure"}}

Returns the _keyval_ associated to event `ev` as an integer, or `#f` if it does
not exists.


// ----------------------------------------------------------------------
{{primitive-doc '(event-keycode ev) "_STklos_ procedure"}}

Returns the _keycode_ associated to event `ev` as an integer, or `#f` if it does
not exists.

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------
{{primitive-doc '(event-modifiers ev) "_STklos_ procedure"}}

Returns a list of the modifiers associated to the `ev` event. The
components of the list can be the following symbols

- _shift_
- _lock_
- _control_
- _mod1_, _mod2_, _mod3_, _mod4_ or _mod5_

If no modifier is pressed. The function returns the empty list.

Example::

[source,scheme]
----
(define w (make <vwindow> :title "Testing events" :width 300 :height 40))

;; define an entry for the test
(define e (make <entry>
            :placeholder-text "Press any mouse button on this entry"
            :parent (list w :expand #t :fill #t)))

;; Connect an event handler to the e entry
(event-connect e "button-press-event"
               (lambda (wid ev)
                 (eprintf "Button pressed. Modifiers: ~S\n"
                          (event-modifiers ev))))
----
*=>*
----
Button pressed. Modifiers: ()
Button pressed. Modifiers: (control)
Button pressed. Modifiers: (control shift)
Button pressed. Modifiers: (mod1 control shift)
----

See also the <<event-connect, *event-connect* primitive>> for details.

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------
{{primitive-doc '(event-button ev) "_STklos_ procedure"}}

Returns the number of the button involved in the event `ev`. If `ev` doesn't
contain a button, `event-button` returns `#f`.


// ----------------------------------------------------------------------
{{primitive-doc '(event-describe ev) "_STklos_ procedure"}}

This primitive prints on the current error port some information on the `ev`
event.

Result looks like this

----
vent description #[GTK-event 707c2c5a9ea0]
             type: KEY-PRESS
           button: #f
        modifiers: (shift)
             char: #\H
           keyval: 72
          keycode: 43
                x: #f
                y: #f

=== Signal primitives


==== Notion of signal

A GTKlos application is, in fact, an event driven application. When an event
occurs (a mouse click, a mouse motion, ...), the application may react to this
event. If there no event, the application is generally idle. When an event
reaches a widget, it may react to this event by emitting a signal. A GTKlos
program can connect a specific _callback_ to a signal. So, a callback is a
kind of handler functions in charge of the signal.


==== Event callback

A signal name is a string (such as "clicked" "enter", "leave",
"destroy", ...). All GTKlos callbacks are Scheme functions with two parameters:

1. the widget receiving the event
2. the event itself

==== Event connection

indexterm:[event-connect _method_]
indexterm:[event-connect-after _method_]
[#event-connect]
To handle a signal, we can add an event handler for this signal. The
connection between the signal and the event is done by the `event-connect`
primitive. This function takes three parameters

1. the widget ti which we want to connect an handler
2. the name of the signal sent when this event occurs
3. the callback function


NOTE: Each widget has a given set of possible signal names that it sends to the application (see the GTK+ documentation for more information).

Hereafter is an example which uses two calls to  `event-connect`
[source,scheme]
----
(define win (make <vwindow> :title "Demo window" :width 300 :height 40))

(define but (make <button> :text "Test button" :parent win))

(event-connect but "clicked"
               (lambda (wid ev)
                 (eprintf "Widget ~S was clicked\n" wid)
                 (event-describe ev)))

(event-connect but "enter"
               (lambda (wid _) (eprintf "We enter the button ~S\n" wid)))
----

An example of output:

[source,text]
----
Widget #[<button> 7b70477ab0c0] was clicked     <= ①
Event description #[GTK-event 7b70477bd720]     <= ②
             type: BUTTON-RELEASE
           button: 1
        modifiers: ()
             char: #f
           keyval: #f
          keycode: #f
                x: 50.0625
                y: 23.7734375
----

We see here that we have:

 1. the mouse enters in the button (event "enter")
 2. the button 1 has been pressed (event "clicked")


NOTE: `event-connect` connects a callback function to a signal for a
particular object. The handler will be called *before* the default handler for
the signal. To connect a callback that will be called *after* the default
handler, you can use `event-connect-after`.


[#command_slot]
==== The command slot

Numerous GTKlos widgets have a slot named `command` which permits to
fast-connect a "clicked" signal to a widget. This signal is generally sent by
reactive widgets when the button 1 or the mouse is clicked over the widget.
Hence, the connection of the "clicked" signal of the previous example
can be done at the button definition:

[source,scheme]
----
(define but (make <button> :text "Test button" :parent win
                  :command (lambda (wid ev)
                             (eprintf "Widget ~S was clicked\n" wid)
                             (event-describe ev))))
----
