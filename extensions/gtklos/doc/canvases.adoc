GTKlos permits to access to the GTK canvas widget if the library
`GooCanvas` is installed {{stklos}} is configured.  `GooCanvas` is a
canvas widget for GTK+ that uses the Cairo 2D library for drawing. It
has a model/view split, and uses interfaces for canvas items and
views.

NOTE: This documentation is built from the original `GooCanvas` documentation
available at the following URL: https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/GooCanvas-2.0

=== Canvas Items

Canvas items (rectangles, ellipses, ...)  are the components that are
displayed in a canvas widget. To add a canvas item in a given canvas, you just
need to set the parent of the canvas item to this canvas.

{{class-doc "canvas-rectangle"}}
==== Class <canvas-rectangle>

A `<canvas-rectangle>` represents a rectangle item. Since it is a subclass
_<gtk-canvas-item>_, it inherits all of the style properties such as `x`, `y`,
`fill-color` or `line-width`.

{{show-class-table <canvas-rectangle>}}

Slots::

- *radius-x* is the horizontal radius to use for rounded corners.
- *radius-y* is the vertical radius to use for rounded corners

Method::

- make-canvas-item {{see-make-canvas-item}}

Example::

[source,scheme]
----
(define w (make <vwindow> :title "Rectangle demo"))
(define c (make <canvas> :parent w :width 400 :height 300))

(define r1 (make <canvas-rectangle> :parent c
                 :x 50 :y 50 :width 100 :height 80 :fill-color "red"))

(define r2 (make <canvas-rectangle> :parent c
                 :x 120 :y 70 :width 140 :height 150
                 :stroke-color "orange" :radius-x 20 :radius-y 20
                 :line-width 5
                 :fill-color "rgba(0,0,255,0.7)"))
----

Here, we define two rectangles, a red one `r1` and a (partially transparent)
blue one `r2`. We obtain:

NOTE: Canvas items receive event signals as standard GTK widgets. For instance
we can define a behavior when entering in `r1` or when cliking `r2`


[source,scheme]
----
(event-connect r1 "enter-notify-event"   (lambda ignore (eprintf "Entering r1\n")))
(event-connect r2 "button-release-event" (lambda ignore (eprintf "Clicked r2\n")))

=== Canvas Base Classes

There are two canvas base classes: `<gtk-canvas-item>` and
`<gtk-canvas-item-simple>`. They are not exported by the GTKlos library.
However, since the slots (an their accessor function) are available in the
library widgets, they are exposed here. Furthermore, all the methods described
here are also available in user programs, once the library has been imported.


{{class-doc "gtk-canvas-item"}}
==== Class <gtk-canvas-item>

The `<gtk-canvas-item>` is the base class of all the items that can be added
in a canvas object.

{{show-class-table (in-module (stklos gtklos) <gtk-canvas-item>)}}

Slots::

- *can-focus* indicates if the item can take the keyboard focus.
- *description* contains a description of the item for use by assistive
   technologies.
- *parent* contains the parent of the canvas item
- *pointer-events* specifies when the item receives pointer events. This is a
   mask value which can be built with the constants
** *CANVAS_EVENTS_NONE* the item doesnât receive events at all.
** *CANVAS_EVENTS_VISIBLE_MASK* a mask indicating that the item only receives
    *events when it is visible.
** *CANVAS_EVENTS_PAINTED_MASK* the item receives events in its painted areas,
    whether it is visible or not.
** *CANVAS_EVENTS_FILL_MASK* a mask indicating that the filled part of the
     item receives events.
** *CANVAS_EVENTS_STROKE_MASK* a mask indicating that the stroked part of the
    item receives events.
- *title* contains a short context-rich description of the item for use by
   assistive technologies.
- *tooltip* contains the tooltip to display for the item.
- *visibility* indicates when the canvas item is visible. Its value can be one
   of the symbols
** *hidden* the item is invisible, and is not allocated any space
** *invisible* the item is invisible, but it is still allocated space
** *visible* the item is visible.
** *visible-above-threshold* the item is visible when the canvas scale setting
    is greater than or equal to the itemâs visibility threshold setting.
- *visibility-threshold* contains the scale threshold at which the item
   becomes visible
- *wid* is a {{stklos}} slot. It contains ta pointer to the GTK object used to
   implement the canvas item . Its value is generally set in the
   <<make-canvas-item, _make-canvas-item_ method>>.  Normal user program
   shouldn't change the value of this slot.

Methods::

[#make-canvas-item]
- *canvas-item-animate* animates an item from its current position to the
  given offsets, scale and rotation. This method takes several keyword
  arguments:
** *x*  (default 0.0): the final x coordinate.
** *y*: (default 0.0): the final y coordinate.
** *scale* (default 1.0): the final scale.
** *degrees* (default: 360.0) the final rotation. This can be negative to
    rotate anticlockwise, and can also be greater than 360 to rotate a number
    of times.
** *absolute* (default `#t`) indicates if the x, y, scale and degrees values are
   absolute, or relative to the current transform.
** *duration* (default 1000): the duration of the animation, in milliseconds.
** *step-time* (default 1): the time between each animation step, in milliseconds.
** *animation-type* (default `freeze`) specifies what happens when the
    animation finishes. This value may be one of the symbols
*** `freeze`: the item remains in the final position,
*** `reset`: the item is moved back to the initial position,
*** `restart`: the animation is restarted from the initial position.
*** `bounce`: the animation bounces back and forth between the start and end
    positions.
- *canvas-item-lower* lowers the given item in the stacking order.
- *canvas-item-raise* raises the given item in the stacking order.
- *canvas-item-remove* removes the item from its parent.
- *canvas-item-rotate* rotates the itemâs coordinate system by the given
   amount, about the given origin. This method takes four for parameters:
** the item to rotate
** *degrees* (a float) which is the clockwise angle rotation
** *cx* (a float) which is the `x` coordinate of the origin of the rotation.
** *cy* (a float) which is the `y` coordinate of the origin of the rotation.
- *canvas-item-scale* scales the itemâs coordinate system by the given amounts.
This method takes three for parameters:
** the item to rotate
** `sx` (a float) is the amount to scale the horizontal axis.
** `sy` (a float) is the amount to scale the vertical axis.
- *canvas-item-stop-animation* stops any current animation for the given item,
   leaving it at its current position.
- *canvas-item-translate* translates the origin of the itemâs coordinate
   system by the given amounts. This method takes three for parameters:
** the item to translate
** `tx` (a float) is the amount to move the origin in the horizontal direction
** `ty` (a float) is the amount to move the origin in the vertical direction
- *initialize-instance* verifies that a parent is given, and calls the
   _make-canvas-item_ method.Ã 
-  *make-canvas-item* creates the GTK canvas item
   object. This method is redefined for each GTKlos descendant of the class
   `<gtk-canvas-item>`.
